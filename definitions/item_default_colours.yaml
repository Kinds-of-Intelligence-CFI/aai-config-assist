# Note, the structure of the item definition:
# item1_name: [r1, g1, b1]
# item2_name: [r2, g1, b2]
# ...
# Above, rN, gN, bN are the red, green, and blue (RGB) component values of the N-th item with name itemN_name.

# Note that all "&" symbols represent anchors to be used later on via aliases with the "*" symbol.
# In other words, parameter values are saved as variables to be loaded at a later stage.
# This way, changing a single colour value can directly impact the colour of multiple objects.

# The following colours marked "Inferred" are placeholders until the exact colours are found.
